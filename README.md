🌐 Revolutionizing Solar Data Integrity

Solar power plants across the world rely on forecasted energy values for planning, billing, scheduling, and trading.

But what if those forecast values are manipulated, corrupted, or tampered?

👉 Billions can be lost.
👉 Power grids can destabilize.
👉 Forecasting models collapse.
👉 Smart grids fail.

Solar Cheat Scan goes beyond forecasting —
It validates, authenticates, and protects solar data using intelligent AI.

This is not just a project —
✨ It is a new layer of security for renewable energy systems.

⚠️ The Hidden Problem Nobody Talks About
❌ No existing system verifies the authenticity of solar forecast data
❌ Subtle manipulation goes unnoticed in massive datasets
❌ Operations, billing & trading depend on unverified values
❌ Manual detection is impossible
❌ Traditional ML behaves like a black box — no transparency

And with India moving toward Smart Grids, the need for trusted renewable data is urgent.

🚨 Solar Cheat Scan: The Solution

A cutting-edge AI system that:

✔ Predicts expected AC power
✔ Detects deviations using tamper scoring
✔ Classifies Normal vs Tampered values
✔ Generates 15-day future forecasts
✔ Provides full transparency through SHAP explainability
✔ Visualizes everything through an interactive dashboard

This is Data Integrity + Machine Learning + Smart Grids = Future-Ready Innovation.
